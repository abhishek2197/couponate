# Couponate!

This [web application](https://couponate.herokuapp.com) was created as a part of KJSCE Hackathon '17 by Team Nothing.   
Couponate revolves around the idea of automating personal coupons with mobile app, web app, chrome extension and Alexa. It starts from parsing coupon codes from user's SMS and ends by automatically applying the codes at checkout, while maintaining a single coupon database. It contains a personal coupon sharing system as well.  
This repo contains just a fraction of the implemented idea.   
This contains the implementation of restful API as well. All CRUD requests to the API work, follows standardized format.  
It uses rails as the backend server.
